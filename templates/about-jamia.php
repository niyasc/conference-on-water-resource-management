	Jamia Millia Islamia was founded in 1920 during the Khilafat Non-Cooperation Movement in response to Mahatma Gandhiâ€™s call to boycott British educational institutions. Jamia reflects the original concern of its founders,which was to encourage the indigenous roots of education. Since its inception, Jamia has been continuously growing,refurbishing its methods and branching out from time to time to meet emerging needs of the society. It seeks to foster national and cosmopolitan perspective in its academic programmes well as in
co-curricular activities. Jamia strives to disseminate knowledge in science and
technology and provides instructional, research and extension facilities in various branches of learning.
In recognition of its services to the nation, Jamia Millia Islamia was declared as Central University by an act of Parliament in 1988. The University is situated in south Delhi and is about 19km from Indra Gandhi International airport, 12 km from the railway stationand 16 km from inter state bus terminal.
